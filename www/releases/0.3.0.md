## Added

 - `.flow-gap` adds margins (in the block direction) between its children.

## Changed

 - **Breaking:**{.bad .bg .color} Changes to how we set margins internally may
   affect your website. Inspect your website visually before upgrading.
 - `.f-switch` was changed to use the `--f-switch-threshold` variable instead
   of `--col-width`. The default threshold was increased.

## Other

 - Many pages of the website were updated in line with changes to the library.
 - The ARIA docs now have examples with proper JS.
 - Dependency on `postcss-mixins` was removed.
