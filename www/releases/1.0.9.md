 - Links:
    - no longer use `--secondary-font`, and will inherit their font family
      instead.
    - have a dotted underline instead of dashed.
 - `<aside>` and `<footer>` elements now use a smaller font size and line
   height.
 - `<small>` elements and elements with the `.<small>` masquerade now use a
   line height matching their font size.
 - Improved interactions on buttons that use `aria-pressed` or `aria-expanded`.
 - Fixed the spacing applied by `.flow-gap` not following the `--density` variable.
 - Fixed button contents not being centered.
